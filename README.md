Hone your skills in the core concepts of working with a MongoDB database in this course with instructor John Cokos. John delves into the CRUD operations—create, read, update, delete—with MongoDB databases. He presents challenges to teach you how to create a database, document schemas, and validation rules, as well as adding documents in those collections manually and through importing and exporting. John then delves into the many ways to query MongoDB databases using JavaScript in MongoShell, Compass, and advanced filtering and aggregations. The challenge series finishes up with some exercises related to updating and deleting documents and collections.
